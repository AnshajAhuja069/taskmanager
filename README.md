Challenges and Solutions

1. Authentication Integration

Challenge: Implementing Firebase authentication with Google Sign-In and ensuring seamless user session management.
Solution: Used Firebase Authentication SDK with React Context API to manage authentication state efficiently.

2. Task Drag-and-Drop Functionality

Challenge: Implementing smooth drag-and-drop task reordering.
Solution: Used the react-beautiful-dnd library to allow intuitive task movement.

3. Efficient State Management

Challenge: Managing state efficiently with real-time updates and minimizing unnecessary re-renders.
Solution: Utilized React Query for optimized data fetching, caching, and automatic updates.

4. File Upload Handling

Challenge: Allowing users to attach files to tasks while ensuring secure storage and retrieval.
Solution: Used Firebase Storage for secure file uploads and provided real-time file previews.

5. Responsive UI Design

Challenge: Ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
Solution: Used CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries with a mobile-first design approach.
